        By <b>2006</b> the <mark>English-language version of Wikipedia had more than one million articles.</mark> <br> And by the time of its 10th anniversary in 2011. <i>it had surpassed 3.5 million. However, while the encyclopaedia continued to expand at a rate of millions of words per month,</i> <br> <strong>the number of new articles created each year gradually decreased,</strong> <br> <u>from a peak of 665,000 in 2007 to 374,000 in 2010.</u> <br> <kbd>In response to this slowdown, the Wikimedia Foundation began to focus its expansion efforts on the non-English versions of Wikipedia, which by 2011 numbered more than 250.</kbd>
