            <h4><q>Human life is a mixture of weal and woe, smiles and tears. However, once what had seemed to be a memorable day turned out to be the saddest day of my life. We had planned for a picnic with all our classmates after the examination on the bank of the river Ganga. We started early in the morning and reached at 10 am. After the cooking was completed, we wished to take a bath in the Ganga. Our class teacher warned that only those who knew swimming would be allowed to bathe in the river. Rajesh, our youngest classmate, did not know how to swim.</q></h4>
